# HR-Analytics-Tableau-Dashboard-
This was an HR Analytics Dashboard based on IBMâ€™s sample employee dataset, where I explored key workforce trends and insights.

In this project, I: 
ğŸ”¹ Imported and cleaned raw data for better usability
ğŸ”¹ Created multiple charts like bar graphs, line charts, and KPI indicators
ğŸ”¹ Used filters and parameters for dynamic interactivity
ğŸ”¹ Designed a clean, user-friendly layout for storytelling
ğŸ”¹ Highlighted key insights like top-performing categories, monthly trends, and regional comparisons.

ğŸ“ŒCreated Viz to show metrics like-
ğŸ”¹ Average Monthly Income visualized by department and job role using interactive tables
ğŸ”¹ Number of Companies Worked For shown using a line chart to track employee movement
ğŸ”¹ Total Employees segmented by department and job role


This hands-on work helped me strengthen my data visualization skills and understand the real impact of good dashboard design in communicating insights clearly.
